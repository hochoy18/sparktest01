* RDD 5个特性
* Internally, each RDD is characterized by five main properties:
*
*  - A list of partitions
*  - A function for computing each split
*  - A list of dependencies on other RDDs
*  - Optionally, a Partitioner for key-value RDDs (e.g. to say that the RDD is hash-partitioned)
*  - Optionally, a list of preferred locations to compute each split on (e.g. block locations for
*    an HDFS file)
